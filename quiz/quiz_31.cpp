#include <iostream>

struct X {
  X() { std::cout << "X"; }
};

struct Y {
  Y(const X &x) { std::cout << "Y"; }
  void f() { std::cout << "f"; }
};

int main() {
  // right
  Y y{X{}};

  // wrong 
  // Y y(X());
  y.f();
}

// The compilation error is on the line y.f(), but the source of the problem is Y y(X());

// This could be interpreted as a variable definition (which was the intention of the programmer in this example), or as a declaration of a function y, returning an object of type Y, taking a function (with no arguments, returning an object of type X) as its argument.

// The compiler is required by the standard to choose the second interpretation, which means that y.f() does not compile (since y is now a function, not an object of type Y).

// Wikipedia has a concise explanation: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Most_vexing_parse, and the standard has more in ยง[stmt.ambig].

// To fix the problem, change Y y(X()) to either Y y{X{}} (modern C++) or Y y((X())) (pre-C++11)
